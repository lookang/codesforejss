Here is an improved writeup for the documentation on GitHub regarding the inclusion and initialization of MathJax for rendering mathematical formulas in HTML panels.

## Adding MathJax for Rendering Mathematical Formulas

### Using CDN for MathJax

To include MathJax in your HTML page using a CDN, add the following script to the `<head>` section of your HTML document:

```html
<head>
    <script id="MathJax-script" async src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"></script>
</head>
```

### Using a Local Copy of MathJax

If you prefer to use a local copy of MathJax, make sure you have MathJax downloaded and added as an element stored in your project directory. 

### Initializing MathJax

After including MathJax, initialize it by adding the following script. This script ensures that MathJax processes and renders the mathematical formulas correctly:

```javascript
// Initialization
MathJax.typesetPromise();
```

### Example: Adding a Math Formula to a Panel

If you have a panel in your HTML where you want to display a mathematical formula, you can use the following approach. Here is an example of an HTML element with a math formula:

```html
<div id="math-panel">
    Math formula: $$\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx$$
</div>
```

### Full Example

Combining all the above steps, here is the complete example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>MathJax Example</title>
    <script id="MathJax-script" async src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="math-panel">
        Math formula: $$\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx$$
    </div>

    <script>
        // Initialization
        MathJax.typesetPromise();
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

By following these steps, you can easily include and initialize MathJax to render mathematical formulas in your HTML documents.
